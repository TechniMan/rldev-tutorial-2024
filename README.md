# [RLDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) Does the Complete RogueLike Tutorial, 2024 Edition

> [Main Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/1dt8bqm/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/)

As every year, following the roguelike tutorial steps as a community for purposes of accountability (i.e. trying to 'get it done', or 'actually complete something') and encouragement to each other.

This year, I'm going for TypeScript, using [ROT.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/), following [Klepinger's tutorial](https://klepinger.dev/rotjs-tutorial/).

## To-Dos

[ ] Finish the tutorial

[ ] Move inlined classes, etc out to their own files (e.g. Actor out of entity.ts) and organise everything into folder modules

[X] ~~Move UI layout around so info is on the side and map view is square~~

[ ] Add intro pop-up when game first loads, explaining controls and objective

[ ] Make the explorable map larger than the visible area, with the camera following the player around

[ ] Fix input action always costing a turn, even if it's just scrolling through the message log

[ ] Replace font with a more square one so square rendering messages are easier to read

[ ] Add random tables to roll against for spawning monsters/loot, and replace procgen's map spawn method with it

[ ] Make classes responsible for their own serialisation/deserialisation
